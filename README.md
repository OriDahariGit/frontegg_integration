# Frontegg IAM Platform Integration ~ React Project~

---

## Introduction

This project implements an integration to the [Frontegg IAM platform](https://frontegg.com/). It is written completely in React and examines a basic utilization of Frontegg's front-end React SDK.


## Notes:

- The project was made as part of an interviewing process I had at Frontegg. Therefore, this repossitory hosts two branches worth noting:
  - **"main"** : represents a solution to a basic set of requirements.
  - **"bonus"** : intends be an imporved version of **"main"**, in terms of API features utilization.
